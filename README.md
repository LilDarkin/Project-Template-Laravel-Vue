## Getting Started Step by Step
1. Clone the project file using git clone https://github.com/LilDarkin/Project-Template.git
2. Open terminal (bash/cmd). Then go to project folder using command

cd project-template
```

3. Then install required files and libraries using 

```sh

```

4. Then create a .env file and generate key for this project using command 

```sh
cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate
```

5. Then compile all CSS & JS files together using this command

```sh

6. Create a database in MYSQL and connect it with your project via updating .env file.
